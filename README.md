# ED-dataset-merge

Merging the three main Event-Detection datasets into one. The datasets we merge are the following:

  - [RAMS](https://nlp.jhu.edu/rams/)
  - [M2E2](https://github.com/limanling/m2e2)
  - [ACE2005](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T06) after being preprocessed by [ace2005-preprocessing](https://github.com/nlpcl-lab/ace2005-preprocessing)


The final product will follow an extended schema of ACE2005.
